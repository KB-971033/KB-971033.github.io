# Your_KB
A sysadmin's reference.

## What is it?
Your_KB is a knowledge base created by a sysadmin for sysadmins. 

IT is an incredibly vast field, and having a mentor when starting out is something everyone should have, but not many do. This site has been created to be your digital mentor; a guide to help you get up speed, get work done, and learn how to do things the right way.

The articles have been compiled from a multitude of resources, tested and verified in production, and are often used by the author themself. They're formatted in a way to make them easy to follow for both new and veteran sysadmins. 

## How do I read your notes?
Everything is formatted as a list of steps. They are broken down by indentation, the further down in the indentation you are, the more low-level steps you'll find.

There's a bit of formatting to help you out:
- **Bold** - Something you click/interact with. For example:
  - Button
  - Tab
  - Text field 
  - Executable
- *Italics* - Something you read. For example:
  - Name of a setting
- \> - A chain of things to click through. For example:
  - Folders
  - Menu
- `Code` - A command or text where formatting/syntax matters.

As UIs change often, the author opted to not include screenshots. It also means that bringing steps up-to-date is quicker, and the article filesize stays small.
